    <h4>For Creamy Smoked Salmon Fettuccine</h4>
    <li>350 g (12 oz) of fettuccine. We used bronze-drawn durum wheat fettuccine by Tuscanini</li>
    <li>200 g (7 0z) of fresh ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>150 g (5 oz) of smoked salmon</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper - to taste</li>
    <li>1 pound shrimp - tails removed, peeled, and deveined</li>
    <li>1 shallot</li>
    <li>1 organic lemon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>120 ml (1/2 cup) of dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of chopped parsley</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>


  <!-- Steps -->
  <ol>
    <li>
      Start by bringing a pot of lightly salted water to a boil for the pasta.
      About 2.5 liters (10 cups) of water with 1 tablespoon of coarse salt.
      Then finely chop the shallot and cut the smoked salmon into small pieces.
    </li>

    <li>
      Saut√© the shallots in a skillet with 2 tablespoons of oil. Then add the smoked salmon.
      Stir and cook for a couple of minutes over medium heat.
      Keep a few pieces of raw salmon aside. You will use them to serve as a garnish for the dish.
    </li>

    <li>
      Add the dry white wine and let it evaporate over high heat.
      Cook for another 2 minutes over medium heat, then turn off the heat and keep aside.
      Now, when the water boils, add the coarse salt.
      Then drop in the fettuccine and cook. Follow the cooking time indicated on the package. This ranges from 6 to 10
      minutes depending on the thickness of the pasta.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separately, put the ricotta cheese, chopped parsley, a scant ladle of pasta cooking water, a pinch of salt and
      pepper, and grated lemon zest in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir vigorously until it forms a smooth, homogeneous cream.If the cream seems too firm and compact, add some of
      the pasta cooking water. This depends on the amount of liquid in the ricotta. Keep aside.Now when the pasta is
      cooked, drain it al dente.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn the heat back on under the pan with the salmon. Then put the fettuccine directly into the salmon and stir.
      Finally add the ricotta cream.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir everything together, turn off the heat, and serve. Decorate with a few pieces of raw smoked salmon and a few
      parsley leaves.Enjoy these Italian creamy smoked salmon fettuccine!
