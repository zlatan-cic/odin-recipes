  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
</div>
<div class="small-container">
  <ul>
    <h4>For Pizza</h4>
    <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
    <li>⅓ cup Best Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
    <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Best Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto</li>
    <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
  </ul>


  <!-- Steps -->
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)
    </li>

    <li>
      Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).
    </li>

    <li>
      Make the pizza sauce: Make the 5 Minute Pizza Sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>
