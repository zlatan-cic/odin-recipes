    <!-- Steps -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all of the ingredients and get them ready before starting the recipe. 
        You won't have time to do two things at once when the risotto is cooking, 
        because you have to stir the dish. Also pour the broth into a saucepan and place it over medium-low heat. 
        You want to get the broth gently simmering but not boiling.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        Once the ingredients are ready, start by cooking the zucchini and shrimp. 
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
        Add the zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 10 minutes until tender and lightly browned. Transfer zucchini to a plate.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        In the same skillet, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. 
        Place the shrimp in the pan in a single layer. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side (8 to 10 minutes total) until the shrimp is opaque and cooked through. 
        Add the lemon juice and lemon zest to the pan and stir just before the shrimp is finished cooking. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, start the risotto. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. 
        Add the onion and garlic, and cook for a few minutes. 
        Stir in the arborio rice, and cook for a few minutes until the edges of the rice become translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, the broth in the saucepan should be gently simmering and hot (but not boiling). 
        Ladle ½ cup of the broth into pot with the rice. 
        Stir vigorously until the broth is absorbed. 
        Repeat this step, adding the hot broth in ½-cup intervals until it has all been incorporated and the rice is creamy. This usually takes about 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the lemon juice, thyme, and parmesan cheese. 
        Then, stir in the zucchini and shrimp. Cook for a few more minutes, 
        stirring frequently, until the dish is warmed through. Serve, and enjoy!
